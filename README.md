# doctorPatientsApplication

Introduction:
This is a project I created for clinics/hospitals to use. It was simply a project for me to learn how to use NetBeans and practice my skills in Java.

To run the program:
Open project on NetBeans and run "Main.java". You can create an account as a patient and/or doctor and log into both portals. The password for the admin portal is "12345".
